    "##### To express conditional logic in Python, you use if statements. When you're writing an if statement, you're relying on another concept we cover in this module, mathematical operators. Python supports the common logic operators from math: equals, not equals, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and greater than or equal to. You're probably used to seeing these operators displayed using symbols, which is how theyâ€™re represented in Python, too.\n",

    "* Greater than: a > b\n",
    "* Greater than or equal to: a >= b\n",

You then determine whether the statement evaluates to True or False. If it's True, the next indented code block is run:"
